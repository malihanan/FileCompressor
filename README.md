# FileCompressor

This is a File Compressor implementing 5 Lossless Compression Algorithms:

* Huffman
* Shannon Fano
* Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW)
* Lempel–Ziv–Storer–Szymanski (LZSS)
* Deflate (LZSS + Huffman)

All the algorithms are implemented in Java. Spring Boot has been used to expose an http endpoint.
